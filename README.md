Introduction to Cross-Currency Arbitrage

The narrator begins by explaining that cross-currency arbitrage is a method to make money in cryptocurrency markets without needing to predict price movements or market direction. He emphasizes that this strategy can be executed on a single exchange platform like Binance, eliminating risks associated with transfer fees, gas costs, or address errors that might occur when moving assets between different exchanges.

The narrator claims that many traders either don't want others to know about this arbitrage method or won't explain how it actually works, positioning the video as revealing "secrets" that others won't share.

Definition and Concept

Cross-currency arbitrage is defined as "buying and selling different currency pairs on the same exchange, taking advantage of the small price mismatch between pairs." The narrator explains that exchanges sometimes price coins slightly differently across trading pairs, creating what he calls a "temporal loophole" that traders can exploit by buying low on one trading pair and selling high on another, all within the same exchange.

Step-by-Step Implementation

The video provides a detailed walkthrough of how to execute this arbitrage strategy:

1.
Locate Trading Section: The narrator directs viewers to find the trade section on the Binance interface.

2.
Select Trading Pairs: He demonstrates how to access different trading pairs, focusing specifically on USDT pairs. He explains that most coins that trade against USDT also trade against BTC, which creates opportunities for arbitrage.

3.
Find Potential Opportunities: The narrator suggests looking for coins that have shown recent price increases (using the example of "AEV" with a 2.63% increase against USDT), as these might have price discrepancies across different trading pairs.

4.
Compare Markets: He shows how to use the "Compare Markets" feature to see the price of the same asset across different trading pairs (specifically comparing the price in USDT versus BTC).

5.
Execute the Arbitrage: The narrator demonstrates a three-step process:

•
Buy the token using USDT (in the example, buying AEV with USDT)

•
Sell the token for BTC (selling the acquired AEV for BTC)

•
Sell the BTC back to USDT to complete the cycle



6.
Calculate Profit: He shows the mathematical calculation of the profit from this three-step transaction, using a 1,000starting capital that results in 1,000 starting capital that results in 
1,000 starting capital that results in
1,015 after completing the cycle, for a $15 profit per transaction.

Profit Potential and Scaling

The narrator emphasizes that this strategy can be repeated multiple times daily. He calculates that performing 50 such transactions in a day could potentially yield 750inprofits(50transactions×750 in profits (50 transactions × 
750inprofits(50transactions×
15 profit). He also notes that using larger capital would result in proportionally larger profits.

The video concludes with the narrator stating that these opportunities are consistently available "as long as cryptocurrency platforms are existing" and encourages viewers to search for price discrepancies between different trading pairs.
